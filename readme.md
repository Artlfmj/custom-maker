# [Custom Maker Bot](https://fortool.fr/cm?tl=en)

## Important note
This project was one of my first projects as a developer. Some commands and events have been rewritten but others have not. At times, you will come across code that is far from clean or optimized.

## Service description
Custom Maker is a certified bot for Discord that aims to aggregate all the data that can be obtained through the APIs related to Fortnite. Its interest: to allow guilds of its users to propose a relative and connected atmosphere to the game.

## Purpose of Open-Source
I think it's a shame that this project was developed to be forgotten and useless but I can't spend as much time on it as I used to.

So the aim is twofold:
- To allow Custom Maker to have new updates for its users
- To allow you, developers, to use its codes in your projects

This is how you can be sure that all your suggestions, questions, or [pull requests](../../pulls) will be processed!

## Contribute
First of all, if you want to contribute to the project, I thank you!

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank [Quentin](https://github.com/QuentinBellus) who, with his [API](https://fortniteapi.io), has allowed me to realize this project and who has been very supportive.

Obviously, **you**, potential contributors without whom the future of this project is uncertain. I invite you to create a dedicated order, if you feel like it, or anything else that could highlight your work!

## Conclusion
I think I have said everything. The future of Custom Maker is in your hands. Its possible future updates will be dedicated to you and I sincerely hope that you will be there!
